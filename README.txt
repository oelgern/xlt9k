eXtreme Light Timer 9000

Have you ever needed a high precision light timer to measure how long an LED flashlight can shina a light? Of course you have!

The growing scientific field of cell-life measurement--by means of measuring the time an LED flashlight can produce a certain intensity of light using a fresh cell--has given rise to the need of a light timer. The eXtreme Light Timer 9000 meets the requirements of scientists measuring cell-life in this manner:
 * Configurable start and stop intensities
 * Autonomous time measurement
 * Cheap
 * Open source
 * Uses readily-available parts
 * Easy to use
